The api:http.annotation.Error[] annotation supports defining either an exception class or an HTTP status. Methods decorated with the annotation are invoked as the result of other controller methods. The annotation also supports the notion of global and local, local being the default.

Local error handlers only respond to methods defined in the same controller. Global error handlers can respond to any method in any controller. A local error handler is always searched for first when resolving which handler to execute.

TIP: When defining an error handler for an exception, you can specify the exception instance as an argument to the method and omit the exception property of the annotation.
